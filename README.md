# 📊 Binance Database Normalization - SQL Project

This project is a simple yet complete SQL implementation of a **cryptocurrency transaction system**, inspired by Binance.  
It was developed as part of my **Database Systems** coursework at Universitas Cakrawala.

## ✅ Objective
To apply database normalization techniques from **1NF to 3NF**, and build a relational database structure using **pure SQL**.

## 🗂️ Structure

- `Pengguna` – stores user info
- `Crypto` – stores cryptocurrency list
- `Transaksi` – records transactions
- `Detail_Transaksi` – links crypto to transaction
- `Harga_Crypto` – logs price history (for 3NF)

## 💻 Technologies
- SQL (MariaDB/MySQL)
- XAMPP (local testing)
- ERD for visualization

## 📦 Includes
- Complete `CREATE TABLE` SQL script
- Insert sample data
- Real ERD diagram
- Manual backup/restore steps
